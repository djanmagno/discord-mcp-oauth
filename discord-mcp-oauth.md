Is it possible to fork the MCP and make it access Discord with my OAuth2 User Authentication? In other words, the LLM (claude) be me.

Absolutely yes! This is actually a brilliant approach. You can fork the
  existing MCP Discord server and modify it to use OAuth2 user authentication
  instead of bot authentication. This way, Claude effectively "becomes you" when
  accessing Discord.

  Forking MCP Discord for User Authentication

  Current MCP Discord Architecture

  - Uses bot token (DISCORD_TOKEN)
  - Requires bot permissions in servers
  - Limited by bot access and admin approval

  Modified Architecture (OAuth2 User)

  - Uses your OAuth2 access token
  - Inherits your permissions automatically
  - No additional server permissions needed
  - Claude acts as you when reading messages

  Implementation Strategy

  1. Fork the MCP Discord Repository

  git clone https://github.com/hanweg/mcp-discord.git
  cd mcp-discord
  git remote add origin your-fork-url

  2. Modify Authentication Layer

  Replace bot authentication with OAuth2:
  - Remove discord.Client() bot initialization
  - Add OAuth2 token management
  - Implement REST API calls using user token
  - Handle token refresh automatically

  Key Changes:
  # Instead of discord.py bot client
  class DiscordUserClient:
      def __init__(self, access_token):
          self.token = access_token
          self.base_url = "https://discord.com/api/v10"

      async def get_messages(self, channel_id, limit=50):
          headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}"}
          # Direct API calls using your permissions

  3. OAuth2 Flow Integration

  Add OAuth2 management:
  - Initial authorization (one-time setup)
  - Token refresh handling
  - Scope management (identify, guilds, messages.read)
  - Session persistence

  4. MCP Tool Interface Updates

  Keep same MCP tools but modify backend:
  - get_messages - uses your channel access
  - get_channels - lists channels you can see
  - get_guilds - shows your servers
  - search_messages - searches with your permissions

  Technical Benefits

  Seamless Integration

  - ✅ Same MCP interface - no Claude Desktop config changes
  - ✅ Your permissions - access exactly what you can access
  - ✅ No admin approval - uses your existing Discord access
  - ✅ Official API - fully compliant with Discord ToS

  Enhanced Capabilities

  - ✅ Direct message access (if you have DM history)
  - ✅ All your servers automatically included
  - ✅ Voice channel info (if you have access)
  - ✅ User-specific data (your mentions, reactions, etc.)

  Implementation Complexity

  Moderate difficulty:
  - OAuth2 setup - standard web auth flow
  - Token management - refresh token handling
  - API conversion - REST calls instead of discord.py
  - MCP compatibility - maintain existing tool interface

  Time estimate: 2-3 hours for full implementation

  The Result

  Once implemented, you'll have:
  - Claude Desktop with Discord MCP access
  - Uses your Discord identity - no separate bot
  - Full access to Mercurius, Dynamo DeFi, and any other servers
  - Same commands as before: "Claude, what's happening in Mercurius
  #conteúdos-abertos?"

  This approach is technically superior because:
  1. No external dependencies (server admins)
  2. Maximum permissions (your full Discord access)
  3. Future-proof (works with any servers you join)
  4. Privacy-focused (only you control the access)

How would work? I would fork the MCP to my machine, then we make the change and then what we should do next?

Great question! Let me walk through the complete process from forking to having
   Claude access Discord as you:

  Complete Implementation Flow

  Step 1: Fork and Setup Local Development

  # Fork the repository to your GitHub account first (via GitHub web)
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mcp-discord.git
  cd mcp-discord
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/hanweg/mcp-discord.git

  Step 2: Modify the Code

  Key changes needed:
  1. Replace Discord.py bot client with direct REST API calls
  2. Add OAuth2 flow for user authentication
  3. Implement token refresh mechanism
  4. Update all MCP tools to use user token instead of bot token

  Step 3: Create Discord OAuth2 Application

  1. Discord Developer Portal → Create New Application
  2. OAuth2 settings → Add redirect URI (e.g., http://localhost:8000/callback)
  3. Copy client ID and secret
  4. Set scopes: identify, guilds, messages.read

  Step 4: Install Your Modified Version

  # In your mcp-discord fork directory
  pip install -e .  # Install as editable package

  Step 5: Update Claude Desktop Configuration

  Modify /Users/djan-vtex/Library/Application 
  Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "discord": {
        "command":
  "/Users/djan-vtex/Documents/Investment-Life-OS/08-System/mcp-env/bin/python",
        "args": ["-m", "your_modified_mcp_discord"],
        "env": {
          "DISCORD_CLIENT_ID": "your_oauth_client_id",
          "DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_oauth_secret",
          "DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:8000/callback"
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Step 6: First-Time Authentication

  1. Run the MCP server for first time
  2. OAuth2 flow triggers - opens browser
  3. You authorize the application with your Discord account
  4. Access token stored securely for future use
  5. MCP server ready with your permissions

  Step 7: Restart Claude Desktop

  # Kill and restart Claude Desktop to load new MCP config
  killall Claude
  open /Applications/Claude.app

  What Happens Next

  Immediate Result

  - Claude Desktop now has Discord access as YOU
  - All your servers are automatically available
  - Your permissions determine what Claude can read
  - No bot approval needed from any server admins

  Usage Examples

  "Claude, what's the latest from Mercurius #conteúdos-abertos?"
  "Show me Dynamo DeFi discussions from the past 24 hours"
  "Summarize crypto sentiment across my Discord servers"

  Behind the Scenes

  1. Claude calls MCP tool (e.g., get_messages)
  2. Your modified MCP server uses stored OAuth token
  3. Discord API call made with YOUR permissions
  4. Messages returned to Claude for analysis
  5. Claude responds with formatted insights

  Technical Architecture

  Authentication Flow

  You → OAuth2 Authorization → Discord → Access Token → Stored Locally → MCP
  Server → Claude

  Token Management

  - Initial auth: One-time browser redirect
  - Token refresh: Automatic background renewal
  - Secure storage: Encrypted local storage
  - Fallback: Re-auth if tokens expire

  Maintenance and Updates

  Keeping Fork Updated

  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main
  # Resolve any conflicts with your OAuth2 changes

  Version Control Strategy

  - Main branch: Your OAuth2 modifications
  - Upstream tracking: Pull updates from original repo
  - Feature branches: For experimental changes

  The Final Result

  You'll have a personalized Discord MCP server that:
  - ✅ Uses your Discord identity
  - ✅ Accesses all your servers automatically
  - ✅ No admin approvals required anywhere
  - ✅ Integrates seamlessly with Claude Desktop
  - ✅ Self-maintaining (token refresh, etc.)
  - ✅ Future-proof (works with any servers you join)

  This creates a truly personal Discord intelligence system where Claude becomes
  an extension of your Discord presence, able to analyze and summarize
  discussions from all your crypto communities in real-time.
